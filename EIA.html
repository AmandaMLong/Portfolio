							<p><center>The BIOL 5100 Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) course portfolio is a compilation of
								assignments showing competency and measures of mastery of ten primary EIA
								subjects covering the principles and practices of preparing environmental
								impact statements and assessments.</center></p>
									<dl>
										<dt>Competency Assignments</dt>
										<dd>
											<p>Aimed to develop the knowledge and skills for the primary subjects
											of Environmental Impact Assessments.</p>
										</dd>
										<dt>Mastery Assignments</dt>
										<dd>
											<p>Required the development of questions with an answer key in such a manner that they can be used to teach.</p>
										</dd>
									</dl>
										<blockquote>"You never know a subject better than when you are expected to teach someone that subject"</blockquote>


							<center><p>We addressed how to interpret the impacts that projects, plans,
							and policies have the on environment as well as the resultant impacts on resources
							ecosystems, and communities. <br>
							We examined methodologies for identifying impacts,
							describing affected environments, predicting and assessing impacts, and selecting a proposed
							action from a group of alternative actions that meets a specific need.</p></center>

											<p><i>Isle Royale National Park Environmental Impact Statement to
												Address the Presence of Wolves</i></p>

							<p><center>Wolves naturally colonized Isle Royale National Park, an island archipelago located in
							Michiganâ€™s Lake Superior, over a 15-mile ice bridge connecting the island to mainland Canada.</p></center>
							<center>For over 60 years, researchers have studied the relationship between trophic levels in the ecosystem,
							wolf-moose and wolf-moose-vegetation. As an apex predator, wolves manage moose abundances and
							distribution, which indirectly manages the vegetation.</center></p>
							<p><center>Recently, as human activities result in climatic changes, the ice bridge connecting the island and mainland has not formed;
							decreasing potential immigration to the island. As a result, wolf populations dramatically declined.</p></center>
							<p>Concerns were raised of the impacts this would have on the moose populations and vegetative forest
							cover on the island. The purpose of the Isle Royale National Park EIS was to address the presence of wolves
								and determine if and how wolves should be reintroduced to Isle Royale.
							The four alternative actions were thoroughly
							considered and accounted for varying alternatives and the biological impacts. The EIS directly
							considered the purpose and need for action, laws and regulations, potential impacts, affected
							environment and predicted and assessed impacts, mitigation, alternatives, and monitoring.</p>
