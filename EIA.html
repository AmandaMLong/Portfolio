								</span><center>In an <i>Environmental Impact Assessment</i> (EIA) course,
								I created a portfolio compiled of assignments showing competency
								and measures of mastery of ten primary EIA subjects covering the
								principles and practices of preparing environmental
								impact statements and assessments.</center></p>
								<dl>
									<dt>Competency Assignments</dt>
									<dd>
										<p>Aimed to develop the knowledge and skills for the primary subjects of Environmental Impact Assessments.</p>
									</dd>
									<dt>Mastery Assignments</dt>
									<dd>
										<p>Required the development of questions with an answer key in such a manner that they can be used to teach.</p>

								<blockquote>"You never know a subject better than when you are expected to teach someone that subject"</blockquote>
								<center><p>We addressed how to interpret the impacts that projects, plans,
									and policies have the on environment as well as the resultant impacts on resources
									ecosystems, and communities. <br>
									We examined methodologies for identifying impacts,
									describing affected environments, predicting and assessing impacts, and selecting a proposed
									action from a group of alternative actions that meets a specific need.</p></center>

											<i>Isle Royale National Park Environmental Impact Statement to

								<p><center>Wolves naturally colonized Isle Royale National Park, an island archipelago located in
								Michiganâ€™s Lake Superior, over a 15-mile ice bridge connecting the island to mainland Canada.</p>
								<center>For over 60 years, researchers have studied the relationship between trophic levels in the ecosystem,
									wolf-moose and wolf-moose-vegetation. As an apex predator, wolves manage moose abundances and
									distribution, which indirectly manages the vegetation.</p>
								<p>Recently, as human activities result in climatic changes, the ice bridge connecting the island and mainland has not formed;
								decreasing potential immigration to the island. As a result, wolf populations dramatically declined.</p>
								<p>Concerns were raised of the impacts this would have on the moose populations and vegetative forest
									cover on the island. The purpose of the Isle Royale National Park EIS was to address the presence of wolves
									and determine if and how wolves should be reintroduced to Isle Royale.
									The four alternative actions were thoroughly
									considered and accounted for varying alternatives and the biological impacts. The EIS directly
									considered the purpose and need for action, laws and regulations, potential impacts, affected
									environment and predicted and assessed impacts, mitigation, alternatives, and monitoring.</p></center>
